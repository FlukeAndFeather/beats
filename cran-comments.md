## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Replaced `\dontrun{}` with `\donttest{}` for long running code [animate_hr()]

* Replaced `\dontrun{}` with `if (interactive)` for Shiny app

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 3.6.2
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
